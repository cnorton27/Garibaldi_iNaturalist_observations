The inside of the tubes is black, except at the lobes. This specimen appeared in my garden after wind, so likely blew down from a western red cedar.  This specimen seems young to me :  it shows little damage, is quite small and is bluish green. 
I found an older specimen and posted it at https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/75183184

This plant is right beside the trail in a steep area where there are mountain bikes and lots of dogs so I wanted to record it now in case it is further damaged. 

Update June 12: I have been watching for blooms. Today I found that the stem had been snapped off because a branch fell beside it, possibly because of a dog running beside the trail. Whatever had been munching on the leaves before this photo was taken had continued to munch. About 1/3 of the leaves had been eaten.

It was the first chance I've had to photograph the malar area without legs, antennae, and tongue confusing the matter. It's the best photo I could get in the conditions as I did not want to risk disturbing the bee. I'm hoping someone expert on bee morphology might be able to assess malar length. The hair seems longer and shaggier than one might expect for B vos. but that could simply be the wet factor. ",Garibaldi Highlands BC,49.747217,-123.112879,,,,Pyrobombus,,538900

I see that there are 10 Research Grade observations of that species in our area but none are caterpillars. Hairs/spines are surprizingly long - when I was cropping the rolled-up photo I had to allow for quite a bit of extra to avoid cutting anything out. The mixture of dark and pale hairs may be helpful with an id.
